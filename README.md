__Part 1__

This is a tutorial on how to create a repository on GitHub using the website and how to connect GitHub to Visual Studio Code.

First, you need to go to GitHub.com. There, you can either sign up for an account or log in using your account. To sign up, you need an email or a connection to a Google or Apple Account. 

After logging in or creating your account, you should be met with your GitHub Dashboard. There, you should see a section to the left-hand side of your screen that says “Create your first project” with two buttons below that state “Create repository” and “Import repository”. For this tutorial, you would want to click “Create repository”. If the “Create your first project” section is not present, you can click the “+” button to the top right-hand side of your screen and select “New repository”.

After selecting the button, you should be redirected to a screen titled “Create a new repository”. There you will see two sections, “General” and “Configuration”. You will also see several text fields and drop down menus that require you to fill them out. 

Under “General”, the first menu is the “Owner” menu, which we will leave alone for now. Then, you are required to give your repository a name. Below that is an optional description of your repository.

The next section, “Configuration” first requires you to choose the visibility of your repository, Public or Private. If you want anyone on the internet to be able to see your repository, you should select public. However, if you want only those you choose to be able to see your repository, you should select private. For both the public and private options you are able to choose who can commit to the repository, or essentially edit files.

After selecting your visibility, the next three options are optional. The first is whether you would want to add a “README” file, which allows for longer written descriptions of what is being done in your repository. The next option is whether you want to add a “.gitignore” file, which you will likely not need now, but essentially when you actually begin to write code and save it in your repository, it tells git what files you do not want saved every time you commit. Then, you will see the option to add a license to your repository which essentially explains to other people who may use your code what they can and cannot do with it.

After you make the necessary selections and specifications, you can click the “Create repository” button at the bottom right-hand side of the screen. Congrats, you have made a repository using GitHub!
